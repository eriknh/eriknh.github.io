Disclaimer: This journal entry is mainly so I can remember the details of this race years later and say, "oh yeah." If I get too preachy or brag, deal with it.

Before we get too far into this, I want to thank my wife who had to wait for me to finish a workout on many occasions. My bike ride would take too long or the swims would run into 2 hour sessions; though she reminded me occasionally that I was late (which I often am), she made getting through the training and eventual event a dream. I could not have done it without her. She is a great sherpa-wife-teammate-badass.
