Disclaimer: This journal entry is mainly so I can remember the details of this race years later and say, "oh yeah." If I get too preachy or brag, deal with it.

Before we get too far into this, I want to thank my wife who had to wait for me to finish a workout on many occasions. My bike ride would take too long or the swims would run into 2 hour sessions; though she reminded me occasionally that I was late (which I often am), she made getting through the training and eventual event a dream. I could not have done it without her. She is also really good at the following things:

1. Tolerating me because I am mostly an irresponsible child deep down.
2. Reminding you that a day off is a good thing and to not feel bad about it.
3. Being a great sherpa-wife-teammate-badass.
4. Gauze wrapping and taping my road rash.
5. Loving me for who I am.

With the actual race being about 2 months away, I was headed into heavy training load weeks in September/October 2019. My main concern were the long runs and being able to recover from the run distance enough to maintain the build momentum. Each week consisted of a track speed session on Wednesday, followed by a short run on Friday, and a long run on Sunday. The run "week" began on Wednesday with a hard track session full of sprints. This session quite frequently put my lower legs into the hurt zone for a couple of days and required many stretching/rolling sessions to ease the tension.
