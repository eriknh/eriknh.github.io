Who am I?

My name is Erik Hensarling; I am a technologist by trade, a husband, athlete, and life enthusiast at all other times.

What is this site for?

I wanted to create an place to journal and write. Most of the stuff here likely won't be that great.

Why use GitHub Pages?

I do not feel like this content should be cataloged directly on social media. Through github pages I can maintain a local copy of this information without a database back end.
